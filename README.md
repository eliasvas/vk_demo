## _A Game Engine, for fun!_


This is an Open Source 3D Game Engine in C and OpenGL. \
The aim of this engine is to be as flexible as possible, and to help \
flesh out ideas quickly! It is built from scratch, no  external libraries.
## Some Features

- Forward+ Physically Based Renderer.
- Skeletal Animations (Sockets / LERP Blending / Additive Blending)
- Immediate Mode UI Library
- Full 3D Math Library
- 3D Physics Engine
- Cascaded Shadow Maps

## Building
To build the engine, you need MSVC.  
Edit build.bat and put your vcvars64.bat at the path space.  
Then just execute build.bat and you should see a \
folder named /build that contains your executable!
